    <h1>Love of my life</h1>
    <ol>
    <li><P>In the vastness of a starlit night,<br>
        A love was born, shining so bright.<br>
        Her smile, a constellation's grace,<br>
        I'm captivated by her celestial face.<br></P></li>
        <br>
        
      <li><p>Her eyes, like galaxies, deep and vast,<br>
        Hold secrets and dreams that forever.<br>
        In her touch, I feel the gentle breeze,<br>
        Whispering melodies that put my heart at ease.<br></p></li>
        <br>
        
       <li><p> Her laughter, a symphony of pure delight,<br>
        Filling my world with colors so bright.<br>
        Her voice, a melody that soothes my soul,<br>
        Guiding me towards love's eternal goal.<br></p></li>
        <br>
        
       <li><p> With every step, she paints a poetic verse,<br>
        A masterpiece that my heart can't rehearse.<br>
        Her presence, a muse that ignites the fire,<br>
        Inspiring words that my soul aspires.<br></p></li>
        <br>
        
       <li><p> In her embrace, I find solace and peace,<br>
        A sanctuary where all worries cease.<br>
        She's the rhythm that dances within my veins,<br>
        A love story that forever remains.<br></p></li>
        <br>
        
     <li><p>So, to my dearest, my love, my muse,<br>
        These words I offer, forever to choose.<br>
        You're the poetry that fills my world,<br>
        And with you, my love, my heart is unfurled.</P></li>
